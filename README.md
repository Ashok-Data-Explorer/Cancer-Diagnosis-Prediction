# Cancer Diagnosis Prediction

Welcome to the Cancer Diagnosis Prediction project! This web application leverages machine learning to predict cancer diagnosis based on patient medical and lifestyle information.

## Project Overview

The Cancer Diagnosis Prediction project is a real-time web application developed using Flask. It aims to assist users in predicting the likelihood of a cancer diagnosis based on various medical and lifestyle factors. This tool allows users to input details such as age, gender, BMI, smoking status, genetic risk, physical activity, alcohol intake, and cancer history to get a prediction.

## User Interface
Features

Cancer Diagnosis Prediction: Predict the likelihood of cancer based on user inputs.
Filters: Input various medical and lifestyle factors such as age, gender, BMI, smoking status, genetic risk, physical activity, alcohol intake, and cancer history.
Real-time Prediction: Get immediate prediction results.
User-friendly Interface: Simple and easy-to-use interface built with Flask.

Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:
### Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Ashok-data-explorer/Cancer-Diagnosis-Prediction.git

Future Work

Feature Integration: Add more predictive features such as family history and genetic markers.
Model Improvements: Explore additional machine learning models and hyperparameter tuning for better performance.
User Experience: Enhance the web application with a more intuitive design and additional functionality.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in the medical field, specifically for early cancer detection. By utilizing patient medical and lifestyle data, the developed model can predict the likelihood of cancer diagnosis with high accuracy. The deployment of the model as a web application makes it accessible for users to input their data and receive a prediction, potentially aiding in early detection and treatment planning. Future enhancements will focus on incorporating more features, exploring additional models, and improving the user experience of the web application.
